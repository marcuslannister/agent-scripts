# Xcode Sync

Synchronize exact Xcode builds across Peter's supported Macs. Use `$remote-mac` for fleet topology and SSH rules.

## Inventory

1. Read `~/Projects/manager/computers.yaml`; use live `tailscale status --json` for reachability/IPs.
2. Exclude handed-off and unknown hosts. Verify `hostname`, user, macOS, architecture, and hardware UUID before writes.
3. Deduplicate Tailscale nodes by hardware UUID; one Mac may have multiple live node records.
4. Run `scripts/xcode-host-inventory.sh` locally or remotely:

```bash
skills/xcode-sync/scripts/xcode-host-inventory.sh
ssh -o RequestTTY=no -o RemoteCommand=none HOST 'bash -s' \
  < skills/xcode-sync/scripts/xcode-host-inventory.sh
```

Treat unreachable hosts as pending, not synchronized. Try live Tailscale IP, Tailscale SSH, then mDNS/LAN only when network topology permits.

## Inspect source

Prefer the user's downloaded `.xip`; do not redownload it.

```bash
pkgutil --check-signature "$archive"
shasum -a 256 "$archive"
stage=$(mktemp -d /tmp/xcode.XXXXXX)
cleanup() { rm -rf "$stage"; }
trap cleanup EXIT
(cd "$stage" && xip --expand "$archive")
set -- "$stage"/Xcode*.app
[[ $# == 1 && -d "$1" ]]
app=$1
plutil -extract CFBundleShortVersionString raw -o - "$app/Contents/Info.plist"
plutil -extract ProductBuildVersion raw -o - "$app/Contents/version.plist"
plutil -extract LSMinimumSystemVersion raw -o - "$app/Contents/Info.plist"
DEVELOPER_DIR="$app/Contents/Developer" xcodebuild -version
cleanup
trap - EXIT
```

Require Apple Software signature. Compare `ProductBuildVersion`, not version label alone: two archives named Xcode 26.6 may contain different builds. Do not use `DTXcodeBuild` as the sync key; it can differ from the build reported by `xcodebuild -version`.

## Compatibility

- Require Apple silicon for an Apple-silicon-only archive.
- Require host macOS >= `LSMinimumSystemVersion`.
- Fleet rule: install Xcode 26.6 only on macOS 26 Tahoe, version 26.2 or newer. Skip macOS 27 Golden Gate even if the bundle launches.
- Apply explicit user exclusions after technical checks.

Never change a host OS to make an Xcode build eligible unless explicitly requested.

## Transfer and install

1. Transfer the signed archive, not an expanded app; preserve resumability:

```bash
rsync -a --partial --progress -e 'ssh -o RequestTTY=no -o RemoteCommand=none' \
  "$archive" HOST:Downloads/
```

2. Verify the remote SHA-256 and signature before expansion.
3. Expand on the destination. Use a single-quoted remote script or `ssh HOST 'bash -s'`; never let the local shell expand remote `$variables` or `$(commands)`.
4. Keep this app policy:
   - current stable: `/Applications/Xcode.app`
   - newest prerelease, beta or RC: `/Applications/Xcode-beta.app`
   - previous-major stable: `/Applications/Xcode-previous.app`, only for three months after a new stable major ships unless the user sets another window
5. Replace same-major point releases and same-channel prereleases; do not preserve them. An RC replaces the beta slot. Validate the staged app, move the old app to a temporary rollback path, install and verify the new app, then delete the rollback copy. Restore the old app on failure.
6. When stable advances to a new major, rotate transactionally: move any existing `Xcode-previous.app` to a temporary rollback path, move the former stable to `Xcode-previous.app`, install and verify the new stable, then delete the older rollback copy. Restore both channel paths on failure. Record the new previous-major removal date in the task report.
7. Stop on unexpected destination collisions. Never delete an app outside these known channels without explicit confirmation.
8. Preserve `xcode-select` unless the user requests a switch. Replacing the app at the already-selected path preserves selection.

Use writable `/Applications` directly. Otherwise use passwordless `sudo -n`; if admin approval is required, show a local macOS authorization prompt or report the exact pending step. Do not bypass receipts or license state.

## First launch and verification

For every installed app:

```bash
DEVELOPER_DIR="$app/Contents/Developer" xcodebuild -version
codesign --verify --deep --strict "$app"
DEVELOPER_DIR="$app/Contents/Developer" xcodebuild -checkFirstLaunchStatus
```

If first-launch status is nonzero:

```bash
sudo env DEVELOPER_DIR="$app/Contents/Developer" xcodebuild -license accept
sudo env DEVELOPER_DIR="$app/Contents/Developer" xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
```

Recheck until status `0`. If sudo/admin UI is unavailable, the app is installed but not ready; report that distinction.

Finish with a host matrix: macOS, desired version/build, installed path, selected path, signature, first-launch state, previous-major removal date, and skip/failure reason. Keep source archives unless deletion is explicitly requested.
